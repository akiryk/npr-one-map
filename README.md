###Data

*Important:* Data is not necessarily accurate and in some cases is simply made up. Do not rely on this data as meaningful for anything other than testing purposes.

This app uses csv data from the `data` directory (currently, stations4.csv). 


###Notes

• Explored d3.js, show site and examples
• Show spreadsheets I used with help from Michelle
• Show map
 - hover for name of station
 - size = TSR
 - filter in a couple of ways (CP vs Springboard or TSR/products)
 – what are the products being used?
• Show graph
